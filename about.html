								SASTRA was established in 1984 as Shanmugha College of Engineering
								and conferred with Deemed-to-be-University status by the Ministry
								of Human Resource Development (MHRD) in 2001. SASTRA
								offers various undergraduate, postgraduate & doctoral programmes in Engineering, Science,
								Management, Law and Arts. SASTRA is re-accredited (III cycle) by the National Assessment
								& Accreditation Council (NAAC) with ‘A+’ grade (CGPA: 3.54/4.00).
								SASTRA has acquired major national and international recognitions this year. First, SASTRA
								has been placed under Category 1 by the University Grants Commission through the
								Categorization of Universities for Grant of Graded Autonomy Regulations, 2018. SASTRA
								becomes one of the 33 Universities in the country and one of the three universities in Tamil
								Nadu to be accorded this status. SASTRA is one of the Institutions to be featured in Times
								Higher Education – World University Ranking 2018, QS Asia Ranking 2018, Times Higher
								Education Asia Ranking 2017 and also in the QS BRICS Ranking. In the National Institutional
								Ranking Framework of the MHRD, Government of India, SASTRA has been ranked 54th
								in Overall, 36th in University and 33rd in Engineering categories. Amongst the private
								Institutions, SASTRA has been ranked 8th in Overall and University and 5th in Engineering
								categories. These multiple National and International recognitions, I believe, has positioned
								SASTRA at a higher plane.
								UNESCO in its 1973 report said that country, which has the highest percentage of educated
								persons would be considered as the wealthiest Nation in the world. Since 2002, SASTRA
								has been conducting Distance Education Programmes with the approval of the competent
								authorities. The Distance Education programmes help to compensate missed opportunities in
								learning and enables career development for all in our Educational rhythm. As per the recent
								directions of the Distance Education Bureau, SASTRA offers only those programmes that are
								offered in the Face-to-Face mode. We follow the rules and regulations of the University Grants
								Commission (UGC) and statutory bodies.
								With adequate infrastructure, dedicated teaching faculty, updated curriculum and syllabus,
								we strongly believe that the learners will have value addition to their degree and competencies.
								Moreover, the self instructional materials for each course has been written by experts in the
								respective subject. Content development and Multimedia facilities are available with us to
								enhance self learning.
								The Directorate of Distance Education also helps students to achieve academic excellence,
								professional competence and social status. We are very happy to invite you to join the Distance
								Education Programme of SASTRA Deemed to be University.
								Prof. R. Sethuraman
								Vice-Chancellor</b></p>
